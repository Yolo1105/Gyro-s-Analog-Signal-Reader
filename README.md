The `initADC()` function in the code is used to initialize the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) of the PIC microcontroller. It prepares the microcontroller to read analog signals from its pins and convert those signals into digital values that the microcontroller can process.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the `initADC()` function is doing:

1. **Set Analog Pin Mode:**
   ```c
   ANSELBbits.ANSB2 = 1;
   ```
   This line sets pin RB2 to analog mode. ANSEL registers control whether pins are in digital or analog mode. When a bit is set, the corresponding pin is switched to analog mode.

2. **Set Pin as Input:**
   ```c
   TRISBbits.TRISB2 = 1;
   ```
   This line configures the data direction of pin RB2 as an input. TRIS registers control the direction of I/O pins. Setting a bit in a TRIS register configures the corresponding pin as an input.

3. **Configure ADC Precision:**
   ```c
   ADCON1bits.AD12B = 0;
   ```
   This line sets the ADC to 10-bit mode (versus 12-bit mode), which affects the resolution of the conversion.

4. **Select Voltage References:**
   ```c
   ADCON2 = 0;
   ```
   This line configures the voltage reference for the ADC conversions. Setting it to `0` typically means that the default voltage references (AVdd and AVss) will be used.

5. **Set ADC Conversion Clock:**
   ```c
   ADCON3 = 0x1F3F;
   ```
   This sets up the ADC conversion clock and the sample time. The sample time is how long the ADC module will "look" at the analog voltage before doing the conversion.

6. **Select ADC Input Channel:**
   ```c
   ADCHSbits.CH0SA = 4;
   ```
   This line selects the analog channel that the ADC will read. It's setting channel 0 to sample from AN4, which is presumed to be connected to the gyro's analog output.

7. **Turn On ADC:**
   ```c
   ADCON1bits.ADON = 1;
   ```
   This line actually turns on the ADC module, making it operational.

When `initADC()` is called, it runs through these steps to ensure that the ADC is correctly set up to read analog voltages from the specified pins. After running this function, the PIC's ADC is ready to convert analog signals into digital values using the `readADC()` function, which starts the conversion process, waits for it to complete, and then reads the result.
